Professionalism &amp; Reproducibility Assignment

In this assignment, we use the Wikipedia Pageviews API to collect monthly page view data. In section 1, we collect mobile, desktop, and cumulative data and store this in 3 unique json object files. In section 2, we use these json object files to perform some simple data visualizations (details found in the notebook).

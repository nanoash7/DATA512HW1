# DATA512HW1
Professionalism &amp; Reproducibility Assignment

In this assignment, we use the Wikipedia Pageviews API to collect monthly page view data. In section 1, we collect mobile, desktop, and cumulative data and store this in 3 unique json object files. In section 2, we use these json object files to perform some simple data visualizations (details found in the notebook).

## Output Files

### JSON Files
rare-disease_monthly_cumulative_201507-202409.json

rare-disease_monthly_desktop_201507-202409.json

rare-disease_monthly_mobile_201507-202409.json

Format:

{  "article": [    {   "project": "",  "article": "",            "granularity": "",            "timestamp": "",            "agent": "",            "views": ""          },         ...      ], ...}

The JSON files are dictionaries where an outkey for each article. Each key maps to an array of JSON objects which hold the monthly pageview data. Each file corresponds to a particular access type (mobile, desktop, cumulative).

### JPG Files

Each of the visualizations created in Step 2 are saved as separate jpg files.

# Using the Code
To replicate this project, run the code blocks in the same order that they are provided. Note: The code in Step 1 takes a while to run, but the output of these steps (the json files) is already created and available for use in Step 2. Therefore, Step 1 can be skipped.
